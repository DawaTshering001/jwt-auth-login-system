# Notes:
# - This workflow assumes the Backend/package.json defines a "test" script.
# - The smoke test hits the root path (/). If your server exposes a health endpoint (e.g. /health), update the curl URL.
# - For production deployments, add a secure step to push images to a registry and deploy with proper secrets.
